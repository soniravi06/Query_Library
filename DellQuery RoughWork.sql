Dellâ€™s documentation is split into two lists of devices that need updating:

Table A: Supported Dell platforms. There are 381 model names here, including Dell brands such as Inspiron, Latitude, OptiPlex, Precision, Vostro. XPS and even some Dell Dock devices.
Table B: End of Service Life Dell platforms. A further 195 model names are listed, including seven Alienware computers.



Dell has included instructions for manually removing the buggy kernel driver, which it says will be found in one of two places:

    C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\dbutil_2_3.sys
    C:\Windows\Temp\dbutil_2_3.sys
If you are nervous about removing system files by hand, the company has published a download page with an automatic driver remover with the remarkable name of Dell-Security-Advisory-Update-DSA-2021-088_7PR57_WIN_1.0.0_A00.EXE.
